# 👨‍💻 Android Developer | Kotlin Enthusiast | Problem Solver

Welcome! I'm an experienced Android developer with a strong focus on creating high-performance, maintainable, and modern applications using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. I love building engaging UIs, exploring clean architecture patterns, and pushing the boundaries of what Android apps can do.

## 💼 What I Do

- 💡 Design and develop scalable Android applications from scratch
- ⚙️ Work with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Coroutines, Flow, and modern Android libraries
- 🧪 Emphasize unit testing, UI testing, and QA automation pipelines
- 📦 Implement clean architecture and modular app structures
- 🛠️ Contribute to reusable components and animation systems
- 🧵 Deep dive into concurrency, performance optimization, and state management
- 🎓 Occasionally teach advanced Android concepts and mentor developers

## 🧠 Learning & Teaching

I’m passionate about deepening my understanding of Kotlin and Android internals, and I love teaching others advanced topics like:
- Coroutines and structured concurrency
- Jetpack Compose recomposition behavior
- Advanced state hoisting and property references
- App architecture design and optimization
